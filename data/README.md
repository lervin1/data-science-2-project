## Overview

In this data subdirectory, you will find both the raw `hotel_bookings` dataset and the `hotel_bookings_new` dataset that was derived from the original dataset.The new dataset is filtered to only look at observations from the year of 2015. This was an important step, as it cut my observations down from over 100,000 to around 20,000, which made machine learning a quicker process. The dataset also provides new variables such as `tot_book`, `cancel_rate`, `room_match`, and `minors`. These variables are included in at least one of my recipes, and a great predictors for hotel cancellations.

This subdirectory also includes the codebook created to provide more information on the variables in the dataset for better understanding while modeling.
