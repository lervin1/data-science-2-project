## Overview

This subdirectory contains the figures that are displayed in the qmd and html documents through the `ggsave()` function. The figures include barplots uncovering information about the target variable, barplots showing the relationship between categorical predictor variables and our target variable, as well as autoplots to uncover the tuning parameters for our models. These figures ultimately add to the complexity of this report, as well as help us try visualize steps during this modeling process.
