## Overview

This subdirectory includes the qmd and html documents for progress memo 1 & 2.

Progress memo 1 instructed us to choose a dataset and briefly analyze it to come up with a prediction question that interested us. It challenged us to find potential roadblocks with the data that we would have to tackle in the modeling process.

Progress memo 2 instructed us to showcase significant progress with our modeling process and have the prediction question we would like to focus on. It challenged us to create 2 recipes as well as fit/tune two models to show significant progress.
