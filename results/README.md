## Overview

This subdirectory includes all of the tuned/fit, workflows, and results for each model. By saving these results were are able to see the `roc_auc` and `accuracy` values for each model, and pick out which one is best for each model to ultimately find our best model. Once we found our best model (the boosted tree model with the basic tree recipe), we were able to conduct a final fit, which results are also saved to this subdirectory. Ultimately, this subdirectory is used for the results of each model as well as the results from our final fit to include in our report.
